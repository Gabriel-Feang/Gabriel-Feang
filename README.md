- Hi, Iâ€™m @Gabriel-Feang
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: gabriel.feang@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ About me: I'm a physician, but I have loved coding since I was 10 when I did my first Game Development course on Adobe Flash. I then progressed to a 3dsMax course when 13 and later got familiarized with Unity and C#. 
- I started getting interested again in programming in my last year at med school, where I had contact with radiology, genetics, and nuclear medicine systems. Initially, it was mostly a hobby. But then I decided to go further and pursue this passion as a career and chose Harvard as my first step into Computer Science due to the great experiences I had with Harvard's medicine courses. I would forget everything about CS50 just to experience the joy of learning with it again, what an experience.
- Started working at Getnet as a Node developer, sometimes also using TypeScript with React on some projects that involve coding a bit of the front-end.
- Got hired by Mercado Libre, and I'm now living the dev dream. Great salary, incredible workspace and culture, Golang everyday... couldn't really ask much more!
