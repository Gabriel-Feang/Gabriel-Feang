- âš¡ About me: I'm a physician, but I love coding since I was 10 (good to mention both my parents are Devs), when I did my first Game Development course on Adobe Flash. I then progressed to a 3dsMax course when 13 and later got familiarized with Unity and C#.
- I started getting interested again in programming in my last year at med school, where I had contact with radiology, genetics and nuclear medicine advancements using AI. I fell in love with the endless potential of artificial intelligence and started studying LLMs and Python on my own.
- But then I decided to go further and pursue this passion as a career and chose Harvard as my first step into Computer Science due to the great experiences I had with Harvard's medicine courses.
